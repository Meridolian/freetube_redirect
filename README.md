# Freetube Redirect

This is a minimalist but functional chrome extension which redirect youtube urls you click on, to Freetube app and prevent your browser from loading youtube page.

## Installation

 - Clone this repository or download the latest release, then unzip it in the folder you want
 - Go to your extension manager
 - Enable developer mode
 - Click on "load unpacked extension"
 - Select this current folder

Enjoy Youtube with privacy :)

PS : It's working fine for me on Arch + Hyprland, don't hesitate to open issues if it does not work on your OS.
